Welcome to L-U-G-E!

<h1> The Instructions</h1>



<p>
The basics: 
	You are a winter sports luger. You are also playing hangman. Your goal is to spell the correct word by picking up the correct letter, in the correct order. You must also dodge the obstacles. You will start by spelling a three letter word. Once you complete it, you will move on to a four letter word, and so on. As a hint, all of the words are themed around animals. If you pickup the wrong letters or run into an obstacle, you loose a life. When you have lost all 5 lives, the game is over. Look for it in the 2018 Winter Olympics, its a new olympic sport.
